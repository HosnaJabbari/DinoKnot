  summary: "RNA-RNA interaction prediction using a hierarchical folding approach."
  description: |
     DinoKnot is a computational tool for predicting RNA-RNA and DNA-RNA interactions, 
     incorporating pseudoknots using a relaxed Hierarchical Folding approach. The algorithm 
     identifies minimum free energy (MFE) structures for two interacting nucleotide sequences, 
     enabling the study of RNA structure and hybridization.

      The software is implemented in C++ and requires a C++11-compatible compiler and 
      CMake (â‰¥3.1) for installation. It is compatible with Linux and macOS and provides a 
      command-line interface for flexible RNA and DNA structure predictions.

      ### Features:
      - Predicts RNA-RNA and DNA-RNA interactions with pseudoknots.
      - Supports pseudoknot-free and constrained structure predictions.
      - Allows user-defined penalty tuning for interaction scoring.
      - Provides hotspot analysis for identifying potential interaction sites.
      - Command-line interface for flexible input handling.
